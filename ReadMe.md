This is code for a Sparkplug B driver for Geo SCADA Expert, written in C# 
for the Simple Driver Framework.

IMPORTANT
Please read the Word file available from SE Exchange Shop for a guide
to customization and implementation.

The driver is offered as source code which you can build with Visual 
Studio. It includes the two parts of the driver and an installer, enabling 
you to build a package to deploy to Geo SCADA Expert servers. It is not 
supported.

The source code is available for you to freely use, modify and extend to 
suit your requirements or that of your clients. It is perhaps not the 
most optimized, efficient or elegant code but we hope that its simplicity 
will encourage engagement with the Geo SCADA driver development process 
and explore the new ideas presented for Sparkplug B implementation with 
Geo SCADA.

The functionality in the driver includes basic data processing, and the 
feature which we hope will stimulate innovation and conversation is the 
built-in automatic configuration facility. This integrates well with the 
Geo SCADA template and instance features.

To implement and deploy this example you will need to add appropriate 
security measures for your environment.

We have developed this technology preview independently of the MQTT 
protocol framework built in to the Geo SCADA Expert product. Feedback 
about this from customers will help us decide how to add a Sparkplug B 
driver to the core product.

You can discuss these features, driver development, MQTT and Sparkplug B 
in the SE Exchange forums.
